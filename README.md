# go-training

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to keep track of my training with golang.

The first steps were made through the CodeSchool course [On Track With Golang][on-track-with-golang] with just the first level (the only one free) and the lecture notes.
The following step is on progress with the udemy full course (paid) [Learn How To Code: Google's Go (golang) Programming Language][learn-how-to-code-golang]

## Courses grade justification

- [CodeSchool's On Track With Golang][on-track-with-golang] [2.5/10]: The course is good enough to make you interested about golang, but it's paid and way too superficial to be worth paying for it.
- [Udemy's Learn How To Code: Google's Go (golang) Programming Language][learn-how-to-code-golang] (still in progress - subject to change in the near future)[8/10]: This is a great course in all levels, from a real begginer in computer science to a more mature software engineer. The downside of the course is that it's way to slow if you are already experienced with some of the subjects on the lessons (in my opinion this disadvantage is really weak to disturb you learning progress). It has been an amazing experience so far, strongly recommended.
